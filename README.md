# Old Komi digital edition

This is a digital edition of Old Komi text corpus. It is based into:

Lytkin, Vasilij I. and Serebrennikov, Boris A. 1952. *Drevnepermskij jazyk: čtenie tekstov, grammatika, slovar'*. Moskva: Izdat. Akad. Nauk SSSR. 169pp.

This repository can be considered a derivative work, since the goal is to provide:

- a version where the text is represented in Old Permic character range in Unicode
- new interpretation of the texts
- POS-tagging
- syntactic analysis

Niko Partanen has initiated the work, but everybody is invited to collaborate. The work is not directly associated with any project or institution, but the work started in 2014 within Kone Foundation funded Iźva Komi Documentation Project.
