# Old Komi digital edition

This is a digital edition of Old Komi text corpus. It is based into:

Lytkin, Vasilij I. and Serebrennikov, Boris A. 1952. *Drevnepermskij jazyk: čtenie tekstov, grammatika, slovar'*. Moskva: Izdat. Akad. Nauk SSSR. 169pp.

This repository can be considered a derivative work, since the goal is to provide:

- a version where the text is represented in Old Permic character range in Unicode
- new interpretation of the texts
- POS-tagging
- syntactic analysis
- etymological analysis

Niko Partanen has initiated the work, but everybody is invited to collaborate. The working model is such that scientifically meaningful contributions built automatically towards the authorship. Logically, out of all possible contributions it should be easy to distinguish the major and minor contributors. Major contribution equals authorship, and all contributions are acknowledged.
